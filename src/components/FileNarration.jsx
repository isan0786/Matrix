  <Card.Header>Chapter1: Alice's Adventure in wonderland </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    
    <Card.Text>
    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice,
"without pictures or conversations?"
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel
very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy–chain would be worth the
trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink
eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of
the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when
the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat–pocket and looked at it and then
hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat–pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and,
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit–hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!
The rabbit–hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she
found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she
went down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it
was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they
were filled with cupboards and book–shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled
"ORANGE MARMALADE," but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not
like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do,
so Alice soon began talking to herself. "Dinah'll miss me very much to–night, I should
think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea–time.
Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!" Alice felt that she was dozing off,
when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all
dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh, my ears and whiskers, how
late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was
no longer to be seen.
She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the
roof. There were doors all ‘round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had
been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly
down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it but
a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of
the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any
rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time ‘round, she came upon a
low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches
high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a
rat–hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever
saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway. "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if
I only knew how to begin."
Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it
("which certainly was not here before," said Alice), and tied ‘round the neck of the bottle
was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large letters.
"No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked ‘poison‘ or not," for she had
never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to
disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked "poison," so Alice
ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry–tart,
custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.
* * * * *
"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a telescope!"
And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the
thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely
garden.
After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at
once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not
possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to
climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired
herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
"Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself rather sharply. "I advise
you to leave off this minute!" She generally gave herself very good advice (though she
very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears
into her eyes.
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and
found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in
currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll get
into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, "Which way? Which way?" holding her
hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she was quite
surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to work and very soon
finished off the cake. </Card.Text>
